It looks like you've shared a handwritten solution to a probability problem involving joint and marginal distributions, as well as checking for independence between two random variables $X\) and $Y\). Let’s go over the main parts of the solution provided.

1. **Problem Statement**: 
   - You’re given a joint probability density function $f(x, y) = 6xy(2 - x - y)$ for $0 \leq x \leq 1$ and $0 \leq y \leq 1$.

2. **Part (i) - Finding $f_X(x)$**:
   - The goal here is to find the marginal distribution of $X$, $f_X(x)$, by integrating out $y$:
     $$
     f_X(x) = \int_0^1 6xy(2 - x - y) \, dy
     $$
   - It looks like you've correctly set up the integration and simplified it to reach $f_X(x) = 4x - 6x^2$.

3. **Part (ii) - Finding $f_Y(y)$**:
   - Similarly, here you're finding the marginal distribution of $Y$, $f_Y(y)$, by integrating out $x$:
     $$
     f_Y(y) = \int_0^1 6xy(2 - x - y) \, dx
     $$
   - After simplifying, you reached $f_Y(y) = 4y - 3y^2$, which appears to be correct based on the work shown.

4. **Part (iii) - Checking Independence**:
   - To check if $X$and $Y$are independent, you need to verify if $f(x, y) = f_X(x) \cdot f_Y(y)$for all $x$and $y$.
   - Based on your calculations, $f(x, y) \neq f_X(x) \cdot f_Y(y)$, so you correctly concluded that $X$and $Y$are not independent.

5. **Part (iv) - Conditional Probability $f_{X|Y}(x|y)$**:
   - Here, you’re asked to find the conditional probability distribution of $X$given $Y = y$.
   - You used the formula:
     $$
     f_{X|Y}(x|y) = \frac{f(x, y)}{f_Y(y)}
     $$
   - After substituting and simplifying, you reached the final expression:
     $$
     f_{X|Y}(x|y) = \frac{6x(2 - x - y)}{4y - 3y^2}
     $$

Your calculations seem consistent with the steps for solving this type of problem. If you have any specific questions on these steps or need clarification on a particular part, feel free to ask!
